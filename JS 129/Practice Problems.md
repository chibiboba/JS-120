#### Object Prototypes

1. What will the following code log to the console? Explain why it logs that value. Try to answer without running the code.

   ```js
   let qux = { foo: 1 };
   let baz = Object.create(qux);
   console.log(baz.foo + qux.foo);
   ```

   Solution

2. What will the following code log to the console? Explain why it logs that value. Try to answer without running the code.

   ```js
   let qux = { foo: 1 };
   let baz = Object.create(qux);
   baz.foo = 2;
   
   console.log(baz.foo + qux.foo);
   ```

   Solution

3. What will the following code log to the console? Explain why it logs that value. Try to answer without running the code.

   ```js
   let qux = { foo: 1 };
   let baz = Object.create(qux);
   qux.foo = 2;
   
   console.log(baz.foo + qux.foo);
   ```

   Solution

4. As we saw in problem 2, the following code creates a new property in the `baz` object instead of assigning the property in the prototype object.

   ```js
   let qux = { foo: 1 };
   let baz = Object.create(qux);
   baz.foo = 2;
   ```

   Write a function that searches the prototype chain of an object for a given property and assigns it a new value. If the property does not exist in any of the prototype objects, the function should do nothing. The following code should work as shown:

   ```js
   let fooA = { bar: 1 };
   let fooB = Object.create(fooA);
   let fooC = Object.create(fooB);
   
   assignProperty(fooC, "bar", 2);
   console.log(fooA.bar); // 2
   console.log(fooC.bar); // 2
   
   assignProperty(fooC, "qux", 3);
   console.log(fooA.qux); // undefined
   console.log(fooC.qux); // undefined
   console.log(fooA.hasOwnProperty("qux")); // false
   console.log(fooC.hasOwnProperty("qux")); // false
   ```

   **Iterative Solution**

   

5. Consider the following two loops:

   ```js
   for (let property in foo) {
     console.log(`${property}: ${foo[property]}`);
   }
   ```

   ```js
   Object.keys(foo).forEach(property => {
     console.log(`${property}: ${foo[property]}`);
   });
   ```

   If `foo` is an arbitrary object, will these loops always log the same results to the console? Explain why they do or do not. If they don't always log the same information, show an example of when the results differ.

#### Dealing with Context Loss

1. The code below should output `"Christopher Turk is a Surgeon"`. Without running the code, what will it output? If there is a difference between the actual and desired output, explain the difference.

   ```js
   let turk = {
     firstName: 'Christopher',
     lastName: 'Turk',
     occupation: 'Surgeon',
     getDescription() {
         return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName + ' is a '
                                     + this.occupation + '.';
     }
   };
   
   function logReturnVal(func) {
     let returnVal = func();
     console.log(returnVal);
   }
   
   logReturnVal(turk.getDescription);
   ```

2. Modify the program from the previous problem so that `logReturnVal` accepts an additional `context` argument. If you then run the program with `turk` as the context argument, it should produce the desired output.

   Show Solution

3. Suppose that we want to extract `getDescription` from `turk`, but we always want it to execute with `turk` as its execution context. How would you modify your code to do that?

   const TESgames = {
     titles: ['Arena', 'Daggerfall', 'Morrowind', 'Oblivion', 'Skyrim'],

     listGames: function() {
       this.titles.forEach(function(title) {
         console.log(this.seriesTitle + ': ' + title);
       });
     }
   };
   
   TESgames.listGames();
   ```

   Will this code produce the following output? Why or why not?

   The Elder Scrolls: Arena
   The Elder Scrolls: Daggerfall
   The Elder Scrolls: Morrowind
   The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion

       increment();
     }
   };
   
   foo.incrementA();
   foo.incrementA();
   foo.incrementA();
   ```

   What will the value of `foo.a` be after this code runs?

2. Rewrite the following code to use object-literal syntax to generate the returned object:

   ```js
   function makeObj() {
     let obj = {};
     obj.propA = 10;
     obj.propB = 20;
     return obj;
   }
   ```

   Show

3. In this problem and the remaining problems, we'll build a simple invoice processing program. To get you started, here's the code to process a single invoice:

   ```js
   let invoice = {
     phone: 3000,
     internet: 6500
   };
   
   let payment = {
     phone: 1300,
     internet: 5500
   };
   
   let invoiceTotal = invoice.phone + invoice.internet;
   let paymentTotal = payment.phone + payment.internet;
   let remainingDue = invoiceTotal - paymentTotal;
   
   console.log(paymentTotal);         // => 6800
   console.log(remainingDue);         // => 2700
   ```

   To process multiple invoices, we need a factory method that we can use to create invoices. The requirements for the factory function are as follows:

   1. It returns an invoice object, with `phone` and `internet` properties, and a `total` method.
   2. The default value for the phone service is 3000, and the internet service is 5500 (in cents, of course!).
   3. The function takes an object argument whose attributes override the default values.

   Your function should work with the following code:

   ```js
   function createInvoice(services) {
     // implement the factory function here
   }
   
   function invoiceTotal(invoices) {
     let total = 0;
   
     for (let index = 0; index < invoices.length; index += 1) {
       total += invoices[index].total();
     }
   
     return total;
   }
   
   let invoices = [];
   invoices.push(createInvoice());
   invoices.push(createInvoice({ internet: 6500 }));
   invoices.push(createInvoice({ phone: 2000 }));
   invoices.push(createInvoice({
     phone: 1000,
     internet: 4500,
   }));
   
   console.log(invoiceTotal(invoices)); // 31000
   ```

   Show Solution

4. Now we can build a factory function to create payments. The function can take an object argument in one of 3 forms:

   - Payment for one service, e.g., `{ internet: 1000 }` or `{ phone: 1000 }`.
   - Payment for both services, e.g., `{ internet: 2000, phone: 1000 }`.
   - Payment with just an amount property, e.g., `{ amount: 2000 }`.

   The function should return an object that has the amount paid for each service and a `total` method that returns the payment total. If the `amount` property is not present in the argument, it should return the sum of the phone and internet service charges; if the `amount` property is present, return the value of that property.

   Your function should work with the following code:

   ```js
   function createPayment(services) {
     // implement the factory function here
   }
   
   function paymentTotal(payments) {
     return payments.reduce((sum, payment)  => sum + payment.total(), 0);
   }
   
   let payments = [];
   payments.push(createPayment());
   payments.push(createPayment({
     internet: 6500,
   }));
   
   payments.push(createPayment({
     phone: 2000,
   }));
   
   payments.push(createPayment({
     phone: 1000,
     internet: 4500,
   }));
   
   payments.push(createPayment({
     amount: 10000,
   }));
   
   console.log(paymentTotal(payments));      // => 24000
   ```

   Show Solution

5. Update the `createInvoice` function so that it can add payment(s) to invoices. Use the following code as a guideline:

   Copy Code

   ```js
   let invoice = createInvoice({
     phone: 1200,
     internet: 4000,
   });
   
   let payment1 = createPayment({ amount: 2000 });
   let payment2 = createPayment({
     phone: 1000,
     internet: 1200
   });
   
   let payment3 = createPayment({ phone: 1000 });
   
   invoice.addPayment(payment1);
   invoice.addPayments([payment2, payment3]);
   invoice.amountDue();       // this should return 0
   ```

2. How would you fix the problem in the code from problem 1?

   Solution

3. Write a constructor function called `Circle` that takes a radius as an argument. You should be able to call an `area` method on any objects created by the constructor to get the [circle's area](https://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/circle-area.html). Test your implementation with the following code:

   ```js
   let a = new Circle(3);
   let b = new Circle(4);
   
   a.area().toFixed(2); // => 28.27
   b.area().toFixed(2); // => 50.27

     swingSword: function() {
       return this.swung;
     },
   };
   
   console.log(ninja.swingSword());
   ```

   Solution

6. Implement the method described in the comments below:

   ```js
   function Ninja() {
     this.swung = false;
   }
   
   // Add a swing method to the Ninja prototype which
   // modifies `swung` and returns the calling object
   
   let ninjaA = new Ninja();
   let ninjaB = new Ninja();
   
   console.log(ninjaA.swing().swung);      // logs `true`
   console.log(ninjaB.swing().swung);      // logs `true`
   ```

   Solution

7. In this problem, we'll ask you to create a new instance of an object, without having direct access to the constructor function:

   ```js
   let ninjaA;
   
   {
     const Ninja = function() {
       this.swung = false;
     };
   
     ninjaA = new Ninja();
   }
   
   // create a `ninjaB` object here; don't change anything else
   
   ninjaA.constructor === ninjaB.constructor // => true
   ```

   Hint

   Solution

8. Since a constructor is just a function, you can call it without the `new` operator. However, that can lead to unexpected results and errors, especially for inexperienced programmers. Write a constructor function that you can use with or without the `new` operator. The function should return the same result with either form. Use the code below to check your solution:

   ```js
   function User(first, last) {
     // ...
   }
   
   let name = 'Jane Doe';
   let user1 = new User('John', 'Doe');
   let user2 = User('John', 'Doe');
   
   console.log(name);         // => Jane Doe
   console.log(user1.name);   // => John Doe
   console.log(user2.name);   // => John Doe

   let pudding = createPet("Cat", "Pudding");
   console.log(`I am a ${pudding.animal}. My name is ${pudding.name}.`);
   pudding.sleep(); // I am sleeping

   neptune.sleep(); // I am sleeping
   neptune.wake();  // I am awake

     play() {
       return 'Start the game!';
     }
   }
   
   class Bingo extends Game {
     rulesOfPlay() {
       // rules of play
     }
   }
   ```

   What would happen if we added a `play` method to the `Bingo` class, keeping in mind that there is already a method of this name in the `Game` class from which the `Bingo` class inherits? Explain your answer. What do we call it when we define a method like this?

   Solution

2. Let's practice creating a class hierarchy.

   Create a class named `Greeting` that has a single method named `greet`. The method should take a string argument, and it should print that argument to the console.

   Now, create two more classes that inherit from `Greeting`: one named `Hello`, and the other `Goodbye`. The `Hello` class should have a `hi` method that takes no arguments and logs `"Hello"`. The `Goodbye` class should have a `bye` method that logs `"Goodbye"`. Use the `greet` method from the `Greeting` class when implementing `Hello` and `Goodbye`; don't call `console.log` from either `Hello` or `Goodbye`.

#### Practice Problems: Mix-ins

[reference](https://launchschool.com/lessons/d5964d17/assignments/e7850b07)

1. If we have a `Car` class and a `Truck` class, how can you use the `Speed` object as a mix-in to make them `goFast`? How can you check whether your `Car` or `Truck` can now go fast?

   ```js
   const Speed = {
     goFast() {
       console.log(`I'm a ${this.constructor.name} and going super fast!`);
     }
   };
   
   class Car {
     goSlow() {
       console.log(`I'm safe and driving slow.`);
     }
   }
   
   class Truck {
     goVerySlow() {
       console.log(`I'm a heavy truck and like going very slow.`);
     }
   }
   ```

   Solution

2. In the last question, we used a mix-in named `Speed` that contained a `goFast` method. We included the mix-in in the `Car` class and then called the `goFast` method from an instance of the `Car` class. You may have noticed that the string printed when we call `goFast` includes the name of the type of vehicle we are using. How is that done?

   Hint: Since the `constructor` property references a function object, `constructor.name` references the `name` property on that object. Use MDN to lookup the definition of `Function.name`.

3. Ben and Alyssa are working on a vehicle management system. Thus far, they have created classes named `Auto` and `Motorcycle` to represent automobiles and motorcycles. After they noticed that the information and calculations performed was common to both vehicle types, they decided to break out the commonality into a separate class named `WheeledVehicle`. Their code, thus far, looks like this:

   ```js
   class WheeledVehicle {
     constructor(tirePressure, kmTravelledPerLiter, fuelCapInLiter) {
       this.tires = tirePressure;
       this.fuelEfficiency = kmTravelledPerLiter;
       this.fuelCap = fuelCapInLiter;
     }
   
     tirePressure(tireIdx) {
       return this.tires[tireIdx];
     }
   
     inflateTire(tireIdx, pressure) {
       this.tires[tireIdx] = pressure;
     }
   
     range() {
       return this.fuelCap *  this.fuelEfficiency;
     }
   }
   
   class Auto extends WheeledVehicle {
     constructor() {
       // the array represents tire pressure for four tires
       super([30,30,32,32], 50, 25.0);
     }
   }
   
   class Motorcycle extends WheeledVehicle {
     constructor() {
       // array represents tire pressure for two tires
       super([20,20], 80, 8.0);
     }
   }
   ```

   Their boss now wants them to incorporate a new type of vehicle: a `Catamaran`.

   ```js
   class Catamaran {
     constructor(propellerCount, hullCount, kmTravelledPerLiter, fuelCapInLiter) {
       // catamaran specific logic
   
       this.propellerCount = propellerCount;
       this.hullCount = hullCount;
     }
   }
   ```

   This new class doesn't fit well with our existing class hierarchy: Catamarans don't have tires, and aren't wheeled vehicles. However, we still want to share the code for tracking fuel efficiency and range. Modify the class definitions and move code into a mix-in, as needed, to share code between the `Catamaran` and the wheeled vehicle classes.
