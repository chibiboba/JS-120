### Lesson 2

##### Object Prototypes

1. What will the following code log to the console? Explain why it logs that value. Try to answer without running the code.

   ```js
   let qux = { foo: 1 };
   let baz = Object.create(qux);
   console.log(baz.foo + qux.foo);
   ```

   Solution

2. What will the following code log to the console? Explain why it logs that value. Try to answer without running the code.

   ```js
   let qux = { foo: 1 };
   let baz = Object.create(qux);
   baz.foo = 2;
   
   console.log(baz.foo + qux.foo);
   ```

   Solution

3. What will the following code log to the console? Explain why it logs that value. Try to answer without running the code.

   ```js
   let qux = { foo: 1 };
   let baz = Object.create(qux);
   qux.foo = 2;
   
   console.log(baz.foo + qux.foo);
   ```

   Solution

4. As we saw in problem 2, the following code creates a new property in the `baz` object instead of assigning the property in the prototype object.

   ```js
   let qux = { foo: 1 };
   let baz = Object.create(qux);
   baz.foo = 2;
   ```

   Write a function that searches the prototype chain of an object for a given property and assigns it a new value. If the property does not exist in any of the prototype objects, the function should do nothing. The following code should work as shown:

   ```js
   let fooA = { bar: 1 };
   let fooB = Object.create(fooA);
   let fooC = Object.create(fooB);
   
   assignProperty(fooC, "bar", 2);
   console.log(fooA.bar); // 2
   console.log(fooC.bar); // 2
   
   assignProperty(fooC, "qux", 3);
   console.log(fooA.qux); // undefined
   console.log(fooC.qux); // undefined
   console.log(fooA.hasOwnProperty("qux")); // false
   console.log(fooC.hasOwnProperty("qux")); // false
   ```

   **Iterative Solution**

   

5. Consider the following two loops:

   ```js
   for (let property in foo) {
     console.log(`${property}: ${foo[property]}`);
   }
   ```

   ```js
   Object.keys(foo).forEach(property => {
     console.log(`${property}: ${foo[property]}`);
   });
   ```

   If `foo` is an arbitrary object, will these loops always log the same results to the console? Explain why they do or do not. If they don't always log the same information, show an example of when the results differ.

   Solution

   

6. How do you create an object that doesn't have a prototype? How can you determine whether an object has a prototype?
