Definition: **Object-Oriented Programming** is a programming paradigm in which we think about a problem in terms of objects. In particular, it uses those objects to organize your program.

- Advantages
  - lets programmers think about a problem at a higher-level of abstraction, which helps them break down and solve the problem.
  - OOP helps programmers write programs that reduce dependencies in a program, which makes maintenance easier. 
  - If done right, OOP makes code flexible, easy to understand, and easy to change. 
- Disadvantages
  - OOP programs are often much larger than the equivalent procedural program. 
  - OOP may lead to less efficient code; OO programs may require more memory, disk space, and computing power.

------

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: is a style of programming that uses objects to organize a program. 

- when we learnt the basics of programming, we thought of a program in terms of variable declarations, conditionals, loops, and function calls. This approach is called procedural programming. The programs used some functional programing techniques like passing functions to array methods like `map` and `filter`. But for the most part, the programs were a series of steps or *procedures* that we performed one after the other. 
- OOP is a **programming paradigm** in which we think about a program in terms of objects.
  - Model a program based on how objects in the real world interact. 
    - A real world object has **state**: properties. (data)
    - It also has **behavior**. (operations / methods)
  - Problems in OOP are sets of objects with state and behavior. 
- we need OOP to organize and maintain code. Using OOP to model objects and use real world nouns to represent objects lets programmers think at a higher level of abstraction. 
- OOP lets programmers write programs that reduces dependencies to maintain code. 
- OO programs are often much larger than non-OO programs. But the organization of a well-designed oOP program can make the program easier to reason about and maintain. OOP programs are not necessarily more efficient.
