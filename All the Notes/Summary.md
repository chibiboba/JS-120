# Summary

This lesson should have helped you solidify your object-oriented knowledge. Despite all the work you've done so far, you're still very new to the world of OOP. If you're still fuzzy on the design aspects of OOP -- how to organize your classes and objects and their behaviors -- that's natural and expected. It's normal to be a bit confused when trying to determine the best way to break down your program into its OOP components, the objects and behaviors. Even developers with years of experience can struggle with these aspects of OOP.

However, there shouldn't be any confusion about how JavaScript implements OOP. You should be familiar with the topics we've covered in this course. In particular:

- You should understand the different ways to create objects in JavaScript, including object literals, object factories, constructors and prototypes (the pseudo-classical approach), the OLOO pattern (prototypal inheritance), and ES6 classes. You should be able to compare and contrast the different ways of creating objects.
- You should understand encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance in a JavaScript context. In particular, you should understand prototypal inheritance.
- You should understand the difference between inheritance, collaboration, and mix-ins.
- You should understand the execution context in JavaScript. In particular, you should be intimately familiar with how JavaScript determines execution context, how it can lose that context, and how you can prevent context loss.
- You should understand both the syntactical and behavioral differences between function declarations, function expressions, arrow functions, and the compact method syntax used in classes and objects.
- You should know how to use both instance and static properties and methods.

If you're comfortable with the above, then you're ready to continue on your journey. Mastering OOP is a life-long journey that requires knowledge of design patterns, architectural tradeoffs, and best practices. Only time and experience can provide that knowledge.

That concludes the instructional part of this course. Next up, the assessment!
