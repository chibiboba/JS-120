# Practice Problems - Classes

1. What do we mean when we say that classes are first-class values?

   Solution

2. Consider the following class declaration:

   Copy Code

   ```js
   class Television {
     static manufacturer() {
       // omitted code
     }
   
     model() {
       // method logic
     }
   }
   ```

   What does the `static` modifier do? How would we call the method `manufacturer`?
