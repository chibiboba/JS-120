# ES6 Classes

ES6 introduced a new `class` keyword to JavaScript. We take a brief look at the `class` keyword [this Gist](https://launchschool.com/gists/6ba85481).

Once you've finished with the Gist, you can finish watching the [JavaScript OOP video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N9tBvlO9Bo&feature=youtu.be) that you began watching earlier. The portion of the video that pertains to this assignment starts at about the 01:25:10 mark and continues through the end of the video (about 14 minutes remaining).

### Summary

ES6 classes provide a cleaner, more compact alternative to constructors and prototypes. As with functions, they are first-class citizens and come in the form of declarations and expressions. Functionally, classes behave almost identically to the constructors and prototypes they aim to replace. Classes allow for static methods by using the `static` modifier.
