# Constructors

**Object constructors**, or **constructors** for short, are another way to create objects in JavaScript. You can think of a constructor as a little factory that can create an endless number of objects of the same type. If that sounds a bit like a factory function, that's okay -- there are some differences, but the basic idea is the same.

Superficially, a constructor looks and acts a lot like a factory function: you define a constructor once then invoke it each time you want to create an object of that type. As we'll see soon, though, there's a little extra that goes into a constructor.

The best way to learn how constructors work is to create one. Let's look at the following `car` object:

Copy Code

```js
let car = {
  make: 'Toyota',
  model: 'Corolla',
  year: 2016,
  started: false,

  start() {
    this.started = true;
  },

  stop() {
    this.started = false;
  },
};
```

We don't just want *a* car, however. We want a mechanism that creates any car that has those properties and methods. To do that, we can use a factory function to create individual cars:

Copy Code

```js
function createCar(make, model, year) {
  return {
    make, // shorthand for `make: make`
    model,
    year,
    started: false,

    start() {
      this.started = true;
    },

    stop() {
      this.started = false;
    },
  };
}

let corolla = createCar('Toyota', 'Corolla', 2016);
let leaf = createCar('Nissan', 'LEAF', 2018);
let nova = createCar('Chevrolet', 'Nova', 1974);
```

This factory function creates new cars of any make, model, or year, and ensures that the engines are initially off.

Another way to accomplish the same thing is to use a constructor function and the `new` keyword:

Copy Code

```js
function Car(make, model, year) {
  this.make = make;
  this.model = model;
  this.year = year;
  this.started = false;

  this.start = function() {
    this.started = true;
  };

  this.stop = function() {
    this.started = false;
  };
}

let corolla = new Car('Toyota', 'Corolla', 2016);
let leaf = new Car('Nissan', 'LEAF', 2018);
let nova = new Car('Chevrolet', 'Nova', 1974);
```

Defining a constructor is nearly identical to defining an ordinary function, but there are differences. For starters, notice that we gave the constructor a name that begins with a capital letter: `Car`. Capitalizing the name isn't a language requirement, but it is a convention employed by most JavaScript developers.

The function parameters, in general, match the properties associated with each `Car` object. In this case, we supply parameters for all of the properties except `started`, which receives an initial value instead. The initial value for such properties can come from anywhere. For instance, we can compute the value from other properties or retrieve a value from a database.

#### Calling a Constructor Function

The most striking features that distinguish constructors from ordinary functions are that:

- we call it with the `new` keyword,
- we use `this` to set the object's properties and methods, and
- we don't supply an explicit return value (we can, but usually don't).

By now, we know that `this` always refers to an object. Which object does it refer to in this function? Of course, we already know the answer to that question: its value depends on how we call the function. Calling constructors is where you see the most significant difference between them and other functions.

Let's create a `Car` object:

Copy Code

```js
let corolla = new Car('Toyota', 'Corolla', 2016);

corolla.make;    // => 'Toyota'
corolla.model;   // => 'Corolla'
corolla.year;    // => 2016
corolla.started; // => false

corolla.start();
corolla.started; // => true
```

Notice that the `new` keyword precedes the function invocation. This combination of using `new` with a function call treats the function as a constructor.

How does that code work, then? What's so different about using the `new` keyword to invoke the function? JavaScript takes the following steps when you invoke a function with `new`:

1. It creates an entirely new object.
2. It sets the prototype of the new object to the object that is referenced by the constructor's `prototype` property. We'll discuss this in a later assignment. We mention it now for completeness.
3. It sets the value of `this` for use inside the function to point to the new object.
4. It invokes the function. Since `this` refers to the new object, we use it within the function to set the object's properties and methods.
5. Finally, once the function finishes running, `new` returns the new object even though we don't explicitly return anything.

We can now use the new object in any manner appropriate for a `Car` object.

**JavaScript won't complain about a missing `new` keyword**.

Copy Code

```js
Car(); // => undefined
```

If you don't use the `new` keyword, the constructor function won't work as intended. Instead, it acts like an ordinary function. In particular, no new objects are created, so `this` won't point to a new object.

Furthermore, since functions that don't return an explicit value return `undefined`, calling a constructor without `new` also returns `undefined`. When you use `new`, however, the function doesn't have to return anything explicitly: it returns the newly created object automatically.

### Who Can be a Constructor

You can use `new` to call almost any JavaScript function that you create. However, you cannot call arrow functions with `new` since they use their surrounding context as the value of `this`:

Copy Code

```js
let Car = (make, model, year) => {
  this.make = make;
  this.model = model;
  this.year = year;
}

new Car(); // TypeError: Car is not a constructor
```

You can also use `new` on methods that you define in objects. Consider:

Copy Code

```js
let foo = {
  Car: function(make, model, year) {
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
    this.year = year;
  }
};

let car1 = new foo.Car('Toyota', 'Camry', 2019);
car1.make; //=> 'Toyota'
```

However, calling a method defined with concise syntax (also called a concise method) won't work:

Copy Code

```js
let foo = {
  Car(make, model, year) {
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
    this.year = year;
  }
};

new foo.Car(); //=> Uncaught TypeError: foo.Car is not a constructor
```

In addition, many -- but not all -- built-in objects and methods are incompatible with `new`:

Copy Code

```js
new console.log(); //=> Uncaught TypeError: console.log is not a constructor
new Math();        //=> Uncaught TypeError: Math is not a constructor
new parseInt("3"); //=> Uncaught TypeError: parseInt is not a constructor

new Date();        //=> 2019-06-26T02:50:20.191Z
```

`new` is also incompatible with special functions known as **generators** (a topic that we don't currently cover at Launch School).

#### Constructors With Explicit Return Values

What happens when you use `new` to call a function that returns an explicit value?

Copy Code

```js
function Cat(name, breed, weight) {
  this.name = name;
  this.breed = breed;
  this.weight = weight;

  return 'a cat';
}

let fluffy = new Cat('fluffy', 'Persian', 15);
fluffy.weight; // 15
```

That's curious. Even though we explicitly returned the string `'a cat'`, our constructor returned the cat object with `name`, `breed` and `weight` as its properties.

Note that `'a cat'` is a primitive value. Suppose we returned an object instead. What would happen, then?

Copy Code

```js
function Cat(name, breed, weight) {
  this.name = name;
  this.breed = breed;
  this.weight = weight;

  return { foo: 1 };
}

let fluffy = new Cat('fluffy', 'Persian', 15);
fluffy.weight; // undefined
fluffy.foo; // 1
```

This time the constructor returned the object `{ foo: 1 }`, not a cat object.

The rule here is that a constructor that explicitly tries to return an object returns that object instead of a new object of the desired type. In all other situations, it returns the newly created object, provided no errors occur. In particular, the constructor ignores primitive return values and returns the new object instead.

### Supplying Constructor Arguments with Plain Objects

Constructor functions sometimes have to grow with the needs of a program. That often means adding more arguments to the constructor. For instance, our `Car` constructor may one day end up looking like this:

Copy Code

```js
function Car(make, model, year, color, passengers, convertible, mileage) {
  this.make = make;
  this.model = model;
  this.year = year;
  this.color = color;
  this.passengers = passengers;
  this.convertible = convertible;
  this.mileage = mileage;
  this.started = false;

  this.drive = function() {
    this.started = true;
  };

  // rest of the methods
}
```

That's quite a few parameters, with plenty of opportunities for mistakes. For instance, we may pass the arguments in the wrong order, and JavaScript won't complain. That might seem like a minor inconvenience, but it causes more bugs than you might think. Not only that, those bugs are often quite nasty and hard to diagnose. The more parameters a function needs, the harder it is to read the code and the more likely that problems will arise.

One common technique that we can use to manage our parameters better involves passing them to our constructor with an object argument:

Copy Code

```js
let civicArgs = {
  make: 'Honda',
  model: 'Civic',
  year: 2016,
  color: 'black',
  passengers: 5,
  convertible: false,
  mileage: 16000
}

let civic = new Car(civicArgs);
```

Of course, that means that we now have to rework our `Car` constructor to accept an object as an argument:

Copy Code

```js
function Car(args) {
  this.make = args.make;
  this.model = args.model;
  this.year = args.year;
  this.color = args.color;
  this.passengers = args.passengers;
  this.convertible = args.convertible;
  this.mileage = args.mileage;
  this.started = false;

  this.drive = function() {
    this.started = true;
  };

  // rest of methods
}
```

With `Object.assign`, we can simplify this constructor considerably:

Copy Code

```js
function Car(args) {
  Object.assign(this, args);

  this.drive = function() {
    this.started = true;
  };

  // rest of the methods
}
```

However, one drawback of the `Object.assign` approach is that the `args` object may contain properties that the `Car` object doesn't need. Those additional properties will, nevertheless, get added to the `Car` object. Those properties may just be excess baggage for the objects to carry around, but they may also cause trouble.

### Determining an Object's Type

Many object-oriented languages, like Java or C++, have a strong notion of object types. In most such languages, it's easy to determine the object's type, such as a dog or car. JavaScript, however, treats objects and their types in a looser, more dynamic way. You can't determine the specific type of arbitrary JavaScript objects; they are dynamic structures with a type of `object`, no matter what properties and methods they have. However, we can get some useful information about an object if we know which constructor created it.

Remember that the `new` operator creates a new object. Suppose that you call the Car constructor with `new`. Informally, we can say that the resulting object is a car. More formally, we can say that the object is an **instance** of a `Car`.

The `instanceof` operator lets us determine whether a given constructor created an object:

Copy Code

```js
let civicArgs = {
  make: 'Honda',
  model: 'Civic',
  year: 2016,
  color: 'black',
  passengers: 5,
  convertible: false,
  mileage: 16000
};

let civic = new Car(civicArgs);

if (civic instanceof Car) {
  console.log("It's a car!");
} else {
  console.log("It's not a car.");
}
```

One effect that we didn't mention when talking about the `new` operator is that the object it returns contains some information that ties it back to the constructor that created the object. The `instanceof` operator uses that information to determine what constructor created the object. We'll talk more about how this mechanism works in the next assignment.

### `new` and Implicit Execution Context

In an earlier lesson, we discussed how a function could receive an implicit execution context. In particular, function and method calls provide an implicit context. For a function call, the implicit context is the global object; for a method call, it's the object used to call the method.

Now that we know about constructors, we can add a constructor call with `new` as a third way to provide an implicit execution context. When you call a function with `new`, its implicit context is the new object.
