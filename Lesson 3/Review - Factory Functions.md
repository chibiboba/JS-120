# Review - Factory Functions

In lesson 1, we learned how to create objects in bulk by using the *factory function* pattern. We'll review that concept before we move forward and discuss some other object creation patterns.

### Factory Functions

Object factories, or factory functions (also called the *Factory Object Creation Pattern*), provide a simple way to create related objects based on a predefined template:

Copy Code

```js
function createPerson(firstName, lastName = '') {
  let person = {};

  person.firstName = firstName;
  person.lastName = lastName;

  person.fullName = function() {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`.trim();
  };

  return person;
}

let john = createPerson('John', 'Doe');
let jane = createPerson('Jane');

john.fullName();        // => "John Doe"
jane.fullName();        // => "Jane"
```

We can simplify that somewhat by returning an object literal:

Copy Code

```js
function createPerson(firstName, lastName = '') {
  return {
    firstName: firstName,
    lastName: lastName,

    fullName: function() {
      return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`.trim();
    }
  };
}
```

The factory function lets us create multiple objects of the same "type" with a pre-defined "template." However, it has some disadvantages:

- Every object created with a factory function has a full copy of all the methods. That's redundant, and it can place a heavy load on system memory.
- There is no way to inspect an object and learn whether we created it with a factory function. That effectively makes it impossible to identify the specific "type" of the object; at best, you can only determine that an object has some specific characteristics.
