# Built-in Constructors

JavaScript comes with a variety of built-in constructors and prototypes that let you instantiate useful objects. These constructors work like constructors for other objects; they're used with the `new` keyword to create objects. In this assignment, we will discuss some of JavaScript's built-in constructors, their prototypes, and how you can extend them.

### The `Array` constructor

You've seen and worked with array objects many times so far. The simplest way to create an array object uses the bracket syntax:

Copy Code

```node
> let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
> numbers
[ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]
```

This syntax is how you usually create arrays in JavaScript. However, you can also use the `Array` constructor:

Copy Code

```node
> let emptyArray = new Array()
> emptyArray
[]
```

As you might suspect, calling `new Array()` creates and returns a new array. That array is empty unless you also pass some arguments to the constructor. Each argument you provide gets added to the new array as an element:

Copy Code

```node
> let numbers = new Array(1, 2, 3, 4)
> numbers
[ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]

> let colors = new Array('green', 'blue', 'yellow')
> colors
[ 'green', 'blue', 'yellow' ]
```

The behavior is considerably different when you provide a single *number* argument. In this case, the constructor creates an array with a length equal to the number specified by the argument, but with no actual elements:

Copy Code

```node
> new Array(3)
[ <3 empty items> ]
```

You can think of `[ <3 empty items> ]` as an array that has three empty slots. In effect, it's an empty array that happens to contain spaces for three items; alternatively, it's a non-empty array that contains no values. Call it SchrÃ¶dinger's array if you wish.

Note that the single-number form of the constructor does not accept non-integers or negative numbers:

Copy Code

```node
> new Array(3.1415)
=> RangeError: Invalid array length

> new Array(-5)
=> RangeError: Invalid array length
```

The single-number constructor, together with the `Array.prototype.fill` method, lets you create arrays with a value that is repeated in every element:

Copy Code

```node
> (new Array(3)).fill('*')
[ '*', '*', '*' ]
```

The `fill` method takes any value as an argument and replaces all elements of the array with that value. Note that the parentheses around `new Array(3)` aren't strictly necessary; however, you should use them for clarity. They show your intent to run `fill` on the new array.

You may recall that the `new` keyword provides some useful behavior when creating new objects. In many cases, omitting the keyword can lead to unexpected behavior and errors. Interestingly, `Array` lets you omit the `new` keyword:

Copy Code

```node
> Array(1, 2, 3)
[1, 2, 3]
```

The behavior of this above code is identical to the earlier example that uses `new Array(1, 2, 3)`.

Some other JavaScript constructors exhibit this behavior. In fact, the ECMAScript specification document requires it in specific cases. However, that doesn't mean that you should omit `new` routinely in your code. You might be using a constructor that doesn't implement this behavior, which can sometimes lead to different behavior when you omit `new`.

For now, don't worry about why the specification requires this behavior or how you can do the same thing yourself. Stay consistent and use `new` unless there's a good reason to omit it.

#### `Array.prototype`

As with any JavaScript function, the `Array` constructor has a `prototype` property. All arrays inherit from the object referenced by this property:

Copy Code

```node
> let numbers = [1, 2, 3]
> Object.getPrototypeOf(numbers) === Array.prototype
true
```

This relationship implies that every array can use the methods defined in `Array.prototype`. In particular, that means that all arrays can use methods like `forEach`, `map`, `includes`, as well as all the other methods defined on `Array.prototype`:

Copy Code

```node
> numbers.map(number => number * number);
[ 1, 4, 9 ]

> numbers.includes(3)
true
```

If you go to the [MDN documentation page for arrays](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array), you'll see a list of all these array methods with names that follow the pattern `Array.prototype.aMethod`. These methods are the instance methods for the Array type.

#### Static Array Methods

Besides instance methods, the array type also has several static methods. We'll discuss two in this section. Remember: static methods belong directly to the constructor function; they aren't part of the prototype used to create new objects. As a result, their names don't include `.prototype`. Moreover, you usually use the constructor to invoke the static methods, not the object created by that constructor. (This definition isn't complete, but it will do for our purposes.)

**Array.isArray**

The `Array.isArray` method takes one argument and returns `true` if the argument is an array object, and `false` if it is not:

Copy Code

```node
> Array.isArray([])
true

> Array.isArray({})
false

> Array.isArray(5)
false
```

Programs often use `Array.isArray` to verify or refute that a given value is an array object. Why do we need it? Won't `typeof` tell us whether the argument is an array? Unfortunately, no. The `typeof` operator returns an unexpected and somewhat useless value when used with an array:

Copy Code

```node
> typeof []
'object'
```

That result may be unexpected, but it shouldn't be too surprising if you think about it. You already know that all arrays are objects. That doesn't make it any less useless, however, so we need `Array.isArray` to distinguish between arrays and other objects.

**Array.from**

The `Array.from` method takes an **array-like object** as an argument and returns a new array with the equivalent element values. An array-like object is any object that has a `length` property and provides indexed access to some of its properties with the `[index]` notation. Such objects have properties whose keys are non-negative integers. In many cases, the `length` property won't self-update if you add or remove properties to or from the object.

Copy Code

```node
> Array.from({0: 'a', 1: 'b', 2: 'c', length: 3})
['a', 'b', 'c']
```

The following code shows one way to implement the logic behind `Array.from`. Studying this code should help you make sense of what `Array.from` does:

Copy Code

```js
let arrayFrom = obj => {
  let len = obj.length;
  let returnArr = [];

  for (let idx = 0; idx < len; idx += 1) {
    returnArr.push(obj[idx]);
  }

  return returnArr;
};

arrayFrom({0: 'a', 1: 'b', 2: 'c', length: 3});
// => [ 'a', 'b', 'c' ]
```

Why would somebody need to do that? It seems silly to create an object that looks like an array but isn't an array. Why bother?

The use case shown isn't particularly useful, but there are other use cases for `Array.from`. In particular, some functions and methods return objects that resemble arrays in some ways but serve some other purpose. For instance, if you use JavaScript to request a list of elements from your browser, the *DOM* (more on that much later) may return an array-like object called a *node list*. Such objects can store *live* data -- dynamic data that can change without intervention by your code. A simple array wouldn't do the trick here, but a node list does. Better yet, the node list is an array-like object, so `Array.from` can create an array based on its content.

In the degenerate case, all arrays are themselves array-like objects.

### The `Object` constructor

As with the `Array` constructor, the `Object` constructor creates new objects:

Copy Code

```node
> new Object()
{}
```

You can invoke `Object` without the `new` keyword, just as you can omit `new` with the `Array` constructor:

Copy Code

```node
> Object()
{}
```

To repeat ourselves, omitting `new` is probably not a good practice.

#### Object.prototype

All objects created by the `Object` constructor or with object literal syntax (e.g., `{ a: 1, b: 2 }`, inherit from `Object.prototype`. Thus, all such objects have access to the instance methods defined in `Object.prototype`. We've already seen some of these methods in action, such as `Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty` and `Object.prototype.isPrototypeOf`.

Since arrays are a subtype of objects, it should come as no surprise that all array objects have access to all the methods on `Object.prototype`.

Copy Code

```node
> ['a', 'b', 'c'].hasOwnProperty(1)
true
```

You can think of the integer indices as properties of the array. In our example, `0`, `1`, `2` are the properties and `'a'`, `'b'`, `'c'` are the values. We can verify that `Array` is a subtype of `Object` by checking whether `Array.prototype` inherits from `Object.prototype`:

Copy Code

```node
> Object.getPrototypeOf(Array.prototype) === Object.prototype
true
```

**Almost all JavaScript objects, whether built-in or custom-created, inherit from `Object.prototype`, either directly or further down the prototype chain.** That includes prototype objects of constructors. Note that we said "almost all"; as discussed in an earlier lesson, it is possible to create objects that don't inherit from `Object.prototype`.

Another oft-used method is `Object.prototype.toString`. It returns a string representation of the object that it's called on. Since `toString` is a method on `Object.prototype`, all JavaScript objects -- including arrays, functions, and dates -- inherit this method. However, the default behavior of `Object.prototype.toString` is not very useful; it merely returns `[object Object]` for objects that don't override this method to provide smarter behavior:

```node
> let obj = { a: 1, b: 2 }
> obj.toString()
'[object Object]'   // not very helpful!

> [1, 2, 3].toString()
'1,2,3'

> let func = function hello() {}
> func.toString()
'function hello() {}'
```

#### Static `Object` Methods

The list below shows some commonly used static `Object` methods. You've already seen and used several. Feel free to follow the links and read more about these methods, but you don't have to memorize them. Instead, learn what's available. You can look them up later when you need to use them:

- [`Object.assign`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/assign)
- [`Object.create`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/create)
- [`Object.entries`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/entries)
- [`Object.freeze`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/freeze)
- [`Object.isFrozen`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/isFrozen)
- [`Object.keys`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/keys)
- [`Object.values`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/values)

### The Date Constructor

The `Date` constructor creates objects, commonly called a **date object**, that represent a specific date and time. Calling `Date` without arguments returns a date object that represents the creation date and time of the object:

Copy Code

```node
> let now = new Date()
> now
2019-06-07T05:03:26.813Z
```

You can create date objects that represent any given date and time by passing additional arguments to the `Date` constructor. For instance, to create a date object that represents "May 1, 1983", you can write:

Copy Code

```node
> let birthday = new Date("May 1, 1983")
> birthday
1983-05-01T07:00:00.000Z
```

You can get even more specific by including the time:

Copy Code

```node
> birthday = new Date("May 1, 1983 05:03 am")
> birthday
1983-05-01T12:03.00.000Z
```

The dates shown by the above code may appear as 1983-05-02. This issue is caused by the time zone of the environment where you run the code. Working with time zones is messy; we won't get into that in this course.

There are several other ways to specify the date and time, including variations on the date strings shown above, and by providing other arguments to the `Date` constructor. Check the [MDN documentation for Date](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) to learn more.

#### Date.prototype

The `Date` prototype object provides a variety of convenient methods for working with dates. We'll mention a few here.

**Date.prototype.toString**

The `toString` method returns a string that represents the date (it's pretty verbose):

Copy Code

```node
> let now = new Date()
> now.toString()
'Sat Jun 01 2019 01:15:06 GMT+0500 (Pakistan Standard Time)'
```

**Date.prototype.getFullYear**

The `getFullYear` method returns the year from the date as a number:

Copy Code

```node
> now.getFullYear()
2019
```

**Date.prototype.getDay**

The `getDay` method returns a number that represents the day of the week that corresponds to the date object. The return value is `0` for Sunday, `1` for Monday, and so on until it returns `6` for Saturday.

Copy Code

```node
> now.getDay()
4 // (represents Thursday)
```

The `Date` prototype has a bunch of useful methods for working with dates and times. Be sure to check the [MDN documentation page for Date](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) and explore a few more methods.

### The `String` Constructor

Why do we need a constructor for strings? Aren't JavaScript strings a primitive type? We know they are since the strict equality operator compares strings by value rather than identity:

Copy Code

```node
> 'abc' === 'abc'
true
```

Two strings with the same characters are considered equal in JavaScript. Equality for objects works by identity, however. Two objects are strictly equal only when they are the same object. Consider:

Copy Code

```node
> let arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
> let arr2 = arr1    // arr1 and arr2 both reference the same object
> arr1 === [1, 2, 3] // false
> arr1 === arr2      // true
```

Interestingly, we can access properties and call methods on strings:

Copy Code

```node
> 'abc'.length
3

> 'abc'.toUpperCase()
'ABC'
```

How is that possible given that strings are primitive values? Primitive values aren't objects, so where does JavaScript find those properties and methods?

We'll return to those questions shortly. First, though, we need to learn that JavaScript has two kinds of strings: string primitives and `String` objects. Thus far, all the strings we've created and used have been string primitives. We create string primitives by using quotes (single or double) or back-tick characters to define a string's value. To create a `String` object, on the other hand, we must use the `String` constructor:

Copy Code

```node
> let strPrimitive = 'abc'
> typeof strPrimitive
'string'

> let strObject = new String('xyz')
> typeof strObject
'object'
```

That's interesting: a string primitive's type is `'string'`, but the `String` object's type is `'object'`. It's clear that JavaScript considers the two types of string as different types. That difference has implications. Consider this code:

Copy Code

```node
> 'abc' === 'abc'
true

> new String('abc') === new String('abc')
false
```

Wow! Two string primitives that have the same value are equal, but not two `String` objects. If you're confused by that, think of poor JavaScript. What's an OOP language to do with weirdness like that? Fortunately, JavaScript is pretty good about remembering what's what.

That still leaves us with a big question: why in the world do we need a `String` object? That goes back to our original question: how can we call methods on string primitives?

The answer is that when you try to access a property or invoke a method on a string primitive, JavaScript *wraps* the string primitive in a `String` object behind the scenes. The process sounds complicated and costly in computing resources, but the implementation is reasonably lightweight; there is little impact on your program. Best of all, the process is invisible.

Once JavaScript has wrapped your string primitive in a `String` object, it then uses the object to access the property or call the method. When the wrapping object has served its purpose, JavaScript discards it.

If a property or method returns a string, it returns a string primitive, so you also don't have to worry about converting `String` objects to primitives.

As a general rule, you should not create `String` objects explicitly. That's where you're likely to run into problems with the distinction between string primitives and `String` objects. However, if you're writing code where you may have to operate on `String` objects, you can use `String.prototype.valueOf()` to retrieve the value of the `String` object as a primitive.

#### `String` Without `new`

As with most constructors, with the notable exception of `Array` and `Object`, calling the constructor without the `new` keyword does *not* create an object. In the case of `String`, it simply returns a new string, not an object, when you omit the `new` keyword:

Copy Code

```node
> let str = String('abc')
> typeof str
'string'
```

The `String` function takes non-string values as arguments as well. In that case, it converts the value to a string:

Copy Code

```node
> String(undefined)
'undefined'

> String(3.14)
'3.14'

> String([1, 2, 3])
'1,2,3'

> String(a => a * a)
'a => a * a'
```

### The `Number` and `Boolean` Constructors

The `Number` and `Boolean` constructors work in much the same way as the `String` constructor. When called with `new`, they create `Number` and `Boolean` objects. When called without `new`, the `Number` function converts its argument to a number, and the `Boolean` function converts its argument to a boolean.

Copy Code

```node
> Number('123');
123

> Boolean(0);
false

> Boolean('abc');
true
```

As with strings, numbers and booleans both have primitive and object forms, and JavaScript invisibly wraps primitives in objects to access methods and properties. You should also avoid creating `Number` and `Boolean` objects explicitly.

### Extending Built-in Prototypes

Since all JavaScript objects derive their behavior from the prototype objects associated with their constructors, we can add new capabilities to our built-in objects by changing those prototypes. For example, we can add a `first` method to all arrays by adding it to `Array.prototype`:

Copy Code

```js
Array.prototype.first = function() {
  return this[0];
}

[1, 2, 3].first(); //=> 1
```

Since we use the array `[1, 2, 3]` to call `first`, `this` inside the function refers to `[1, 2, 3]`. Thus, the `first` method returns the first element of the array used to call it, or `undefined` if the array is empty.

Extending built-in objects is interesting to study, but it's best to avoid doing so. Adding a method like `first` to an array object can confuse other developers working on your project. It can lead to errors when other developers forget or don't realize that your array has an unexpected bonus.

### Borrowing Array Methods for Strings

First-class functions in a programming language provide several benefits. One significant benefit is that methods aren't tied to a particular object type. Using explicit context-binding techniques, we can apply a method to a different object type than the one that defines the method. This "method borrowing," however, doesn't make sense for every object and every method. For example, it doesn't make sense to use the `getDay` date method on an array.

Array methods, however, are surprisingly useful with `String` objects. We can borrow many array methods to manipulate `String` objects. Consider the following code:

Copy Code

```js
let string = 'EEE';
Array.prototype.every.call(string, char => char === 'E'); // => true
```

JavaScript strings don't have an `every` method, but we can use `Array.prototype.every` on our string by using `call` or `apply`. Here, we use `every` to determine whether the string `EEE` contains all `E` characters.

We can shorten that expression noticeably by using an empty array instead of `Array.prototype` as the calling object:

Copy Code

```js
[].every.call(string, char => char === 'E'); // => true
```

Why does method borrowing work? Let's look at a simplified implementation of `Array.prototype.every`:

Copy Code

```js
Array.prototype.every = function(callback) {
  for (let index = 0; index < this.length; index++) {
    if (!callback(this[index])) return false;
  }

  return true;
};
```

Note how the method uses `this` to access the length and elements of the array that called it. Since `String` objects also have a `length` property and use index-based element access, this code works with strings as well as arrays.

Let's see another example:

Copy Code

```js
[].filter.call('olives', val => val < 'm'); // [ 'l', 'i', 'e' ]
```

Notice that the `filter` method returns an array, even though we called it on a string. If you think about it, that makes sense. The `call` and `apply` functions don't change a function's logic or return values; they merely change what object the method uses for its context. Array methods that return an array will still do so even when called on a string value. If you need a string result, you can use `join` to convert the array to a string:

Copy Code

```js
[].filter.call('olives', val => val < 'm').join(''); // => 'lie'
```

Note that not all array methods can operate on strings. Consider the following example:

Copy Code

```js
let ingredients = 'olives';
[].push.call(ingredients, ' and pepper');
// TypeError: Cannot assign to read only property 'length' of object '[object String]'
```

Array methods that mutate the array won't work with strings. Again, that makes sense: strings are immutable.
