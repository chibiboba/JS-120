# Practice Problems - Constructors and Prototypes

1. What does the following code log to the console? Try to answer without running the code. Can you explain why the code produces the output it does?

   Copy Code

   ```js
   let RECTANGLE = {
     area: function() {
       return this.width * this.height;
     },
     perimeter: function() {
       return 2 * (this.width + this.height);
     },
   };
   
   function Rectangle(width, height) {
     this.width = width;
     this.height = height;
     this.area = RECTANGLE.area();
     this.perimeter = RECTANGLE.perimeter();
   }
   
   let rect1 = new Rectangle(2, 3);
   
   console.log(rect1.area);
   console.log(rect1.perimeter);
   ```

   Solution

2. How would you fix the problem in the code from problem 1?

   Solution

3. Write a constructor function called `Circle` that takes a radius as an argument. You should be able to call an `area` method on any objects created by the constructor to get the [circle's area](https://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/circle-area.html). Test your implementation with the following code:

   Copy Code

   ```js
   let a = new Circle(3);
   let b = new Circle(4);
   
   a.area().toFixed(2); // => 28.27
   b.area().toFixed(2); // => 50.27
   a.hasOwnProperty('area'); // => false
   ```

   Solution

4. What will the following code log to the console and why?

   Copy Code

   ```js
   function Ninja() {
     this.swung = true;
   }
   
   let ninja = new Ninja();
   
   Ninja.prototype.swingSword = function() {
     return this.swung;
   };
   
   console.log(ninja.swingSword());
   ```

   Solution

5. What will the following code output and why? Try to answer without running the code.

   Copy Code

   ```js
   function Ninja() {
     this.swung = true;
   }
   
   let ninja = new Ninja();
   
   Ninja.prototype = {
     swingSword: function() {
       return this.swung;
     },
   };
   
   console.log(ninja.swingSword());
   ```

   Solution

6. Implement the method described in the comments below:

   Copy Code

   ```js
   function Ninja() {
     this.swung = false;
   }
   
   // Add a swing method to the Ninja prototype which
   // modifies `swung` and returns the calling object
   
   let ninjaA = new Ninja();
   let ninjaB = new Ninja();
   
   console.log(ninjaA.swing().swung);      // logs `true`
   console.log(ninjaB.swing().swung);      // logs `true`
   ```

   Solution

7. In this problem, we'll ask you to create a new instance of an object, without having direct access to the constructor function:

   Copy Code

   ```js
   let ninjaA;
   
   {
     const Ninja = function() {
       this.swung = false;
     };
   
     ninjaA = new Ninja();
   }
   
   // create a `ninjaB` object here; don't change anything else
   
   ninjaA.constructor === ninjaB.constructor // => true
   ```

   Hint

   Solution

8. Since a constructor is just a function, you can call it without the `new` operator. However, that can lead to unexpected results and errors, especially for inexperienced programmers. Write a constructor function that you can use with or without the `new` operator. The function should return the same result with either form. Use the code below to check your solution:

   Copy Code

   ```js
   function User(first, last) {
     // ...
   }
   
   let name = 'Jane Doe';
   let user1 = new User('John', 'Doe');
   let user2 = User('John', 'Doe');
   
   console.log(name);         // => Jane Doe
   console.log(user1.name);   // => John Doe
   console.log(user2.name);   // => John Doe
   ```
