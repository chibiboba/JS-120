# Dealing with Context Loss I

In the next three assignments, we'll discuss how functions and methods can "lose context." We've used quotes since functions don't lose their execution context in reality -- they always have one, but it may not be the context that you expect. If you understand how execution context is determined, you shouldn't be surprised by the value of `this` in any given scenario. That said, how a specific context is arrived at isn't always intuitive. Even when you understand the rules, the context for any given invocation may surprise you.

In these assignments, we'll talk about the different scenarios and how to deal with them. In this first assignment, we'll study what happens when a method is copied out of an object and used elsewhere.

### Method Copied from Object

In an earlier assignment, you saw what happens when you take a method out of an object and execute it as a function or as a method on another object. In either case, the function's context is no longer the original object. For instance:

Copy Code

```js
let john = {
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe',
  greetings() {
    console.log('hello, ' + this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName);
  },
};

john.greetings();         // context is john
let foo = john.greetings; // Strips context
foo();                    // context is now the global object
```

You could use `foo.call(john)` to restore the original context, but suppose you don't execute the function right away or you need to pass it to another function for execution? By the time `foo` gets called, `john` may be out of scope.

Copy Code

```js
function repeatThreeTimes(func) {
  func(); // can't use func.call(john); john is out of scope
  func();
  func();
}

function foo() {
  let john = {
    firstName: 'John',
    lastName: 'Doe',
    greetings: function() {
      console.log('hello, ' + this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName);
    },
  };

  repeatThreeTimes(john.greetings); // Strips context
}

foo();

// => hello, undefined undefined
// => hello, undefined undefined
// => hello, undefined undefined
```

One way to solve this problem is to change `repeatThreeTimes` to accept the context object as a second parameter, then pass the context to `repeatThreeTimes` when calling it.

Copy Code

```js
function repeatThreeTimes(func, context) {
  func.call(context);
  func.call(context);
  func.call(context);
}

function foo() {
  let john = {
    firstName: 'John',
    lastName: 'Doe',
    greetings: function() {
      console.log('hello, ' + this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName);
    },
  };

  repeatThreeTimes(john.greetings, john);
}

foo();

// hello, John Doe
// hello, John Doe
// hello, John Doe
```

Some of JavaScript's built-in methods, such as the Array abstraction methods like `forEach`, `map`, and `filter`, use this technique. Such methods take a callback function as an argument and an optional `thisArg` context object that gets used as the callback's execution context.

However, it's not always possible to pass a context argument to a function or method; you may not even be able to change the function if, say, it belongs to a third-party library. Besides, it's generally not a good idea to pass a lot of arguments to your functions; the more arguments a function can accept, the harder the function is to use.

Another approach you can use is to hard-bind the method's context using `bind`:

```js
function repeatThreeTimes(func) {
  func();
  func();
  func();
}

function foo() {
  let john = {
    firstName: 'John',
    lastName: 'Doe',
    greetings: function() {
      console.log('hello, ' + this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName);
    },
  };

  repeatThreeTimes(john.greetings.bind(john));
}

foo();

// => hello, John Doe
// => hello, John Doe
// => hello, John Doe
```

`bind` has one significant advantage: once you bind a context to a function, that binding is permanent and does not need to be repeated if it gets called more than once. The disadvantage of `bind` is that it is no longer possible to determine the context by looking at the invocation of the final function.

In the next assignment, we'll study how functions can lose their surrounding context. Loss of surrounding context is a common issue when dealing with functions nested within object methods.
