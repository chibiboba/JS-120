### Function Expressions

##### Review on 3 ways to define a function

1. **Function declaration**: when function definition is the first thing on a line. 

   - Function definition that starts with word `function` at beginning of statement. 

   - Function declaration binds a function to an identifier, declares the existence of the function. 

   - Function declarations can't be anonymous.
   - Function declarations are **hoisted**: can be called before function is defined. 

   ```js
   functionName(); // can invoke function before function is defined.   
   
   function functionName() {
     ...
   }
   ```

2. **Function expression**: function definitions that are part of an expression. 

   - Function expressions are not **hoisted** : can't use function expressions before you define them. 

   - Any function definition that doesn't have the word `function` at the **<u>beginning</u>** of a statement is a function expression. 

     ```js
     let functionName = function () { // Anonymous function expression
       ...
     }; // note the semi colon here! It's an expression so it needs semicolon. 
     ```

     ```js
     let functionName = (parameter) => {
       
     };
     ```

   - Wrapping what looks like a function declaration in parentheses creates a function expression

     ```js
     // Function expression, not declaration
     (function greetPeople() {
       console.log("Good Morning!");
     }); 
     ```

     ```js
     function makeGreeter(name) {
       return function greeter() {
         console.log(`Hello ${name}`); 
       }
     }
     // Greeter is a function expression because it starts with return. 
     ```

   - Function expressions are often anonymous. Such as callback functions for array methods like `forEach` and `map`. 

     ```js
     let squaredNums = [1, 2, 3].map(function(num) {
       return num * num;
     }); // => [1, 4, 9]
     ```

   - Function expressions **<u>don't</u>** have to be anonymous: You can name a function expression. 

     -  use `Function` keyword can be used to define a function inside an expression. 

       ```js
       let squaredNums = [1, 2, 3].map(function squareNum(num) { // call back functions don't have to be anonymous
         return num * num;
       }); // => [1, 4, 9]
       ```

     - Or omit name to create anonymous function expressions. 

   - However, the function name given to a function expression is **not visible** in the scope that includes the function expression. 

     - `foo` is a local variable that contains a reference to the function, so we can invoke the function using `foo()`. However, the function name, `bar`, is not in scope on line 3, so `bar()` does not work.

     ```js
     let foo = function bar() {};
     foo();         // This works
     bar();         // This does not work, the function name bar is not in scope on line 3. 
     ```

   - Advantage of naming a function expression

     - The main advantage of naming a function expression occurs when the function throws an error (raises an exception). If the function has a name, the stack trace uses that name to help you determine where the error occurred. Without the name, JavaScript merely reports the location as "anonymous.

   - We typically assign a function expression to a variable or object property, pass it to another function, or return it to a calling function. 

     ```js
     let prompt = function() { // Assign to a variable
     
     };
     
     [1, 2, 3].forEach(function(elem) { // pass to another function
       console.log(elem);
     });
     
     
     function makeIncrementer(increment) {
       return function(value) { // return to caller
         return value + increment;
       }
     }
     ```

3. **Arrow function**

   - Arrow functions are always function expressions
   - Are always anonymous. 

   ```js
   let greetPeople = () => console.log("Good Morning!"); // 0 parameters
   let greetPeople = paramOne => console.log("Good Morning!"); // 1 parameter,
   let greetPeople = (paramOne, paramTwo) => console.log("Good Morning!") // 2 parameters
   
   greetPeople(); // Must invoke after defining the function. 
   ```

   - Arrow functions have an interesting feature: **implicit returns**: can omit return statement when function body contains a single expression, on a <u>**single line**</u>. 

   ```js
   [1, 2].map(element => return 1 ); // map invokes anonymous callback function here
   ```

**Anonymous Function**: a function with no name. 

- No declaration syntax for arrow functions. 
- Arrow functions are always function expressions. 
  - Which means they be invoked by the variable name. 
  - Also means we often pass them around or assign them to variables or properties. 

- Arrow functions are always anonymous: there's no way to define a named arrow function. 
  - Arrow functions are <u>immediately invoked</u>(will discuss later) assigned to variables or properties, or passed around as arguments and return values. 
- Call back functions for methods like `forEach` and `map` are **<u>often</u>** anonymous functions, but <u>don't have to be!</u>   

```js
let name = function (x) { // function expression
  
});

let name = () => console.log('My name is'); // arrow function
```
